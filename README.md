# **Symbiotic entities metadata repository**

This repository is designed to manage metadata and related resources for decentralized entities, such as vaults, networks, operators, tokens, points, and curators.
It provides a standardized structure for organizing and accessing information about these entities.
By contributing to this repository, you help create a reliable, decentralized knowledge base. After being merged, this
data will be used in [app.sepolia.symbiotic.fi]() to provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about various entities in the DeFi ecosystem.

## **How to Add a New Entity to the Repository via Pull Requests**

### **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

```
repository/
├── vaults/
│   ├── 0x<address>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
├── networks/
│   ├── 0x<address>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
├── operators/
│   ├── 0x<address>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
├── tokens/
│   ├── 0x<address>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
├── points/
│   ├── <points_distributor_id>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
├── curators/
│   ├── <curator_id>/
│   │   ├── info.json
│   │   └── logo.png (optional)
```

Each entity is identified by its Ethereum address (`0x...`), Points distributor ID (for points) or Curator ID (for curators), and its data is stored in a folder named after the address or ID. Inside this folder, there must be a file `info.json` containing metadata, and optionally, an icon file `logo.png`.

### **Steps to Add a New Entity**

**Note: After your PR is submitted, email your PR link to verify@symbiotic.fi from your official business email (domain must match that of your entity website) to allow us to confirm your identity ahead of merging your PR.**

1. **Determine the entity type**:
    - Decide whether the entity belongs to `vaults`, `networks`, `operators`, `tokens`, `points`, or `curators`.
    - If the entity is a `vault` or `points`, please be sure that it's collateral token entity is registered in the `tokens` folder before adding the vault metadata. If not, please add the token first.
2. **Register the entity in the registry**:
    - Before adding metadata for vaults, networks, or operators, ensure that they are registered in their respective registries. You can find the current registry contract addresses in the [Symbiotic documentation](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/deployments/current). Unregistered entities will not be accepted.
4. **Create a new folder**:
    - Navigate to the appropriate directory for the entity type.
    - Create a folder named after the Ethereum address (e.g., `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`) or point ID (e.g., `kalypso`).
5. **Add the `info.json` file**:
    - Include metadata in the specified format (see below).
6. **(Optional) Add an icon file**:
    - If available, include a `logo.png` file with the entity’s logo.

Your PR will be reviewed by the symbiotic team, and if approved, it will be merged into the repository. Please note that the PR will be reviewed only after the entity is checked with automated checks.
